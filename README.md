- 👋 Hi, I’m @rodgersajb
- 👀 I’m interested in: coding some cool and useful projects 💻, cooking (with a lot of spice 🌶🌶), being the best father 👨🧒👶 (oh, and husband 💑), golf ⛳ and figuring out where to travel next - 🗺🏖✈
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript and some more advanced features for React.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some wonderful Front End Projects while learning a ton along the way
